Predicting churn using machine learning is very useful because it allows businesses to identify customers who are likely to leave, so that they can take proactive steps to prevent them from doing so. This can help businesses retain more customers, increase customer loyalty, and improve customer satisfaction. Additionally, it can help businesses better understand customer behavior, allowing them to make more informed decisions about their products and services.
